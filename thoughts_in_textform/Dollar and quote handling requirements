dollar handling problems
'$USER		: gets ignored because of unclosed ' at the front
"$test t	: chars after non existing env var dont get written.


new quote handling requirements:

if quote of any kind is found, search for matching second quote.
if second quote is found, put everything in between those quotes into one node as T_WORD
if second quote is not found, continue normally

new $ handling requirements:

if content starts with ', check if it ends with ' as well.
if content starts and ends with ', ignore it.

otherwise search for '$'.
if '$' found, save string before '$'. (before)
save string after '$' untill next whitespace or oend of string. (searched)
if not at end of string, save everything after string after '$'. (after)
append '=' to searched.
match searched against env.

if match is found join before with matched string from searched onward. (new)
then join new with (after). (output)
replace content with output.

if match is not found, join before with after. (output)
replace content with output.
